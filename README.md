### Mozilla 
The overall structure for these web extensions is provided by the Mozilla Web Extensions Tutorials. These can be found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/<br />
This project was very heavily based in mozilla's code, as it is full of new concepts to me as a developer.

I primarily used the "Your Second Web Extension" tutorial. It can be found here:<br /> 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_second_WebExtension

**All Mozilla code, content, and ideas are Â© Mozilla and individual contributors.**
